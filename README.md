# LTE-simulation-project
Lte simulation project developed by Leiyang Guo and Paritosh Gaiwak

CONTENT OVERVIEW:

Reference code.m includes Matlab references for the project;

Uplink+SINR(varying location).m contains simulation codes used for testing and analysis on 3 eNodeB and 1 UE model, including SINR 
derivation, UE throughput measurement, and downlink and uplink simulation;

hENBscalingFactors_5.m includes the function modified for evaluating scaling factors for 4 interference eNodeB cells (5 eNodeBs in total);

nodes_5.m includes simulation for 5 eNodeB and 1 UE (with predefined SINR and noise);
